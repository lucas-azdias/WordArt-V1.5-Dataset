The competition focused on the **recognition of text in artistic and stylized images** — a challenging problem that combines aspects of OCR, computer vision, and typography understanding.

**WordArt-V1.5** includes a wide variety of:
- Artistic and decorative text styles,
- Diverse fonts and visual distortions,
- Real-world and synthetic samples from creative media such as posters, advertisements, and digital artwork.
